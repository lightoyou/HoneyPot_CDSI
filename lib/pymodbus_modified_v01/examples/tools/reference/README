Modbus Reference Implementations
============================================================

The following are used as reference implementations for the
various portions of the modbus protocol.

Checksum Calculations
------------------------------------------------------------

The two reference implementations for the lrc and crc computations
were taken from the appendix of the fieldtalk serial implementation
guide.

Reference Server and Client
------------------------------------------------------------

The two reference implementations were provided by the modbus
driver team (http://www.modbusdriver.com/modpoll.html). Attached
is the license that the binaries are released under.

.. note::

   The enclosed binaries will only work on linux 2.6,
   however the site does provide binaries for a number of
   alternate systems as well.

Code
------------------------------------------------------------

I believe that this is the code for the two supplied utilities:
